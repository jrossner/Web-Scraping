The idea for this project is a person can enter their __state__, __email address__, and __time frame__ to get email notifications in advance of registration deadlines for USA's federal & state level elections in their state.

Would involve scrapping this site: https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/state-elections/state-election-dates-deadlines.htm?stateName=MA&electionLevel=Federal+and+State
